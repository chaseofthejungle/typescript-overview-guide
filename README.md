# TypeScript Overview Guide
**Definition/Overview:** JavaScript (JS) is a 'loosely' or 'weakly' typed language, which means that variables are not required be defined to types. Consequently, guessing the meaning of JavaScript (JS) code can be a challenge when the context of a coding environment (such as the implementation itself) does not make its purpose obvious and/or documentation is missing or unclear. Fortunately, *TypeScript* assists developers by specifying variable data types and reporting type mismatch errors (such as if a function expects a string value but is passed an integer) at compile time (before the code is run, rather than when it is executed).

Some of the TypeScript features that this guide will cover include:
  
* Creating new types via mapping.
* Defining object types with dynamic keys.
* Extending interfaces to include specific properties.
* Type transformations, utilizing utility types.
