# TypeScript Overview Guide
**Definition/Overview:** JavaScript (JS) is a 'loosely' or 'weakly' typed language, which means that variables are not required be defined to types. Consequently, guessing the meaning of JavaScript (JS) code can be a challenge when the context of a coding environment (such as the implementation itself) does not make its purpose obvious and/or documentation is missing or unclear. Fortunately, *TypeScript* assists developers by specifying variable data types and reporting type mismatch errors (such as if a function expects a string value but is passed an integer) at compile time (before the code is run, rather than when it is executed).
